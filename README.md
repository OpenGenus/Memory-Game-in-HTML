# Memory Game in HTML, CSS and JS

In this Project at OpenGenus, we explored Memory Game in HTML, CSS and JS.

This is the code repository for the game. In this game, we were focused on using DOM and adding elements. 

The article related to this repository is [here](https://iq.opengenus.org/memory-game-using-js-and-html/)

The basic Rules of this game are:

<ol>
        <li> Match the cards before 30 moves or 5 minutes.</li>
        <li> After the close button is hit the time starts to tick. </li>
        <li> The page will auto-reload when the game is over. </li>
        <li> You can't choose other tiles nor can you match yourself.</li>
        <li> After wrong matching, wait for a second to match again. </li>
</ol>
