# Memory Game in HTML, CSS and JS

In this Project at OpenGenus, we explored the famous chrome game.

This is the code repository for the game. In this game we were focused on using DOM and add elements. 

The article related to this repository is [here](https://iq.opengenus.org/p/8e37a6b0-b717-4bc4-860d-e5ffaa36f751/)

Basic Rules of this game are:

<ol>
        <li> Match the cards before 30 moves or 5 minutes.</li>
        <li> After the close button is hit the time starts to tick. </li>
        <li> The page will auto reload when game is over. </li>
        <li> You can't choose other tiles nor can you match self.</li>
        <li> After wrong matching, wait for a second to match again. </li>
</ol>
